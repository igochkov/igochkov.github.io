> Any fool can know. The point is to understand.
> 
> — Albert Einstein

Welcome to "Sparks Of Intelligence," a place where we explore the world of thinking machines and human curiosity. This blog is all about diving into the world of artificial intelligence, the many uses of Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) models, and the mysterious idea of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Think of it as a personal notebook, filled with ideas, thoughts, and deep research. I created it to share my journey as I move from just knowing things to really getting to the bottom of them.

At "Sparks Of Intelligence," we're on a quest to make sense of the fast-paced field of smart machines and how they learn. We're inspired by the wise words of Albert Einstein: "Any fool can know. The point is to understand." This blog is here to break down tough ideas, chat about the latest in tech, and think deeply about intelligence. It's a place for those who don't just want to gather facts but who want to connect the dots to form a bigger picture.

I'm inviting you to come along on this journey of discovery, as I note down what I learn, question what I think I know, and maybe even spark new ideas for you, too. Whether you're already into AI, just starting to get interested, unsure about it all, or simply stumbling upon this topic, "Sparks Of Intelligence" is your chance to join the conversation about the smart technology that's changing our lives. Let's go beyond just knowing stuff—let's try to really understand the heart of intelligence, in all its shapes and forms.
