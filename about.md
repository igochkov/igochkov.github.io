My name is Ivaylo Gochkov. I am a programmer and software architect, living and working in The Netherlands. My passion for programming started in the early 80s. I have worked with many programing languages and paradigms, but my professional career is built on .Net, Object-oriented programming, C#, JavaScript and T-SQL. I love coaching and sharing knowledge. 

This is a technical blog about things I have worked on, technolgy experience, as well as ideas for future projects.
